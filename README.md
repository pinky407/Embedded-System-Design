# Embedded-System-Design

Embedded System is combination of Hardware and Software. These Systems are designed to do perticular task and with necessary peripherals required yo run it.  embedded systems are time-critical applications which are not possible in general purpose systems. These devices including telephones, automobiles, electronic appliances and other digital devices are working around us, round the clock.

## Embedded-system-architecture

In Embedded Systems hardware is designed for the perticular purpose and sameas the software. The hardware and software are interlinked to each other so that the system reduces the price, time and tools. The main part of the embedded system is the processors.Some other interfaces and peripherals are interfaced to the system based on the requirements. 


## Processor
There are many options while choosing a processor. These include

- General purpose microprocessor
- Microcontroller
- Digital signal processors
- Field programmable gate array (FPGA)
- Complex programmable logic devices (CPLD)
- System on chip (SoC)
- Each of these devices has their own advantages and disadvantages, they are used based on the complexity of the application.
